<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The FuelStream front-end gets its content from a <span class="caps">JSON</span> <span class="caps">API</span> powered by <a class="reference external" href="http://expressionengine.com/">Expression Engine</a>. <span class="caps">EE</span> is a <span class="caps">CMS</span> built on <span class="caps">PHP</span> and CodeIgniter.
It provides a very powerful content-entry system with the ability to model data directly through the admin. This means that&#8217;s
it&#8217;s more than a <span class="caps">CMS</span>, it&#8217;s an easy-to-provision <span class="caps">PHP</span> back-end&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>ExpressionEngine&#8217;s performance is not exceptional. It uses an <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model"><span class="caps">EAV</span></a>, which provides plenty of flexibility, but requires lots of
<span class="caps">SQL</span> queries to generate content, especially when the content is used to create a <span class="caps">JSON</span> <span class="caps">API</span> with hundreds of records rather than
single pages, such as would be seen in a vanilla <span class="caps">CMS</span> with &#8220;page&#8221; objects. EAVs also have trouble taking advantage of database
joins, which are almost a necessity when building complex queries that need to perform well. We were faced with a serious
problem since our <span class="caps">API</span> requests were taking close to <strong>20 seconds</strong> to complete when the site was under&nbsp;load.</p>
<p>We used <a class="reference external" href="http://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon <span class="caps">RDS</span></a> for the database. Nothing special there, you pay a little more to have Amazon manage the database <span class="caps">OS</span>, optimization,
replication, and you get some nice tools to do point-in-time restoration. If you&#8217;re using MySQL and <span class="caps">EC2</span>, it&#8217;s a&nbsp;no-brainer.</p>
<p>All components of the cluster have full&nbsp;redundancy:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>4 web/application servers (Varnish, nginx,&nbsp;<span class="caps">PHP</span>)</li>
<li>2 file servers&nbsp;(GlusterFS)</li>
<li>The built-in redundancy and health-checking of Cloudfront, <span class="caps">ELB</span>, and&nbsp;<span class="caps">RDS</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="distributing-assets">
<h2>Distributing&nbsp;Assets</h2>
<p>A common issue when your webapp outgrows a single server setup is how to distribute assets among the servers. There are several
ways to solve this including directing all content-generating traffic to a single server and replicating the assets via rsync. I&#8217;ve
found that using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gluster.org/">GlusterFS</a> provides a very robust and reliable system for file&nbsp;replication.</p>
<p>GlusterFS is very cool.  Two servers in the cluster do nothing but store files. The web-servers have a network filesystem share and file writes
to that share are immediately replicated to both GlusterFS servers. Every asset stored in Gluster essentially has two physical copies, one
on each file server. If one of them goes down, the GlusterFS client (on the web-servers) is smart enough to switch to the other
server. When the server comes back up, it heals itself from the active&nbsp;server.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this redundancy and reliability comes with a huge cost. File access performance is greatly reduced. There are some efforts to
improve the client-side caching that Gluster does, but I&#8217;ve found that it&#8217;s still&nbsp;lacking.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="performance-improvements">
<h2>Performance&nbsp;Improvements</h2>
<p>The easiest way to improve performance of a web app is to simply reduce the number of requests to the server that the clients
make. This means offloading static asset requests for images and <span class="caps">CSS</span> to a <span class="caps">CDN</span>.  <a class="reference external" href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Amazon CloudFront</a> makes this very easy. You just send
the client through CloudFront and it caches your content for you. Once it&#8217;s on CloudFront, it never has to hit your servers again. <span class="caps">CF</span>
also has the very cool benefit of distributing your content around the world, so users get routed to a server that&#8217;s close to them&nbsp;geographically.</p>
<p>Keeping <em>page</em> requests from hitting the server was a bit tougher. We use Amazon&#8217;s Elastic Load Balancer to transparently proxy requests
to one of four web servers. On those web servers, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/">Varnish Cache</a> sits in front of nginx and works as a caching proxy. Once a page is requested
and rendered, it&#8217;s stored in <span class="caps">RAM</span> for a set amount of time, regardless of who made the initial request. This makes subsequent requests extremely fast
since <span class="caps">PHP</span> is not invoked and data does not have to be retrieved from the database, it can be served directly from&nbsp;<span class="caps">RAM</span>.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
uncached request: client -&gt; ELB -&gt; Varnish -&gt; nginx -&gt; PHP -&gt; database
  cached request: client -&gt; ELB -&gt; Varnish (RAM cache)
</pre>
<p>Since our <span class="caps">API</span> responses take so long to generate we have to be very aggressive with our caching.  The solution here was to &#8220;warm&#8221; the
cache automatically, making sure that no client traffic ever hits uncached&nbsp;content.</p>
<p>Note that FuelStream has a huge benefit over most web apps since it&#8217;s session-less. There is no use of user-login or history.
Whenever you introduce sessions to an application, caching becomes much more&nbsp;difficult.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cache-warming">
<h2>Cache&nbsp;Warming</h2>
<p>To warm the cache, we created a script that runs at an interval lower than the cache&#8217;s timeout value. This script makes a special <span class="caps">HTTP</span>
request to the Varnish cache servers, telling them to do an in-place replacement of the cached content from the database. (using the <tt class="docutils literal">req.hash_always_miss</tt>
variable in Varnish <span class="caps">VCL</span>) Only the warming script gets to see the slow loading times. It&#8217;s an emotionless robot that constantly
surfs the site and makes sure the cache is minty&nbsp;fresh.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This setup means that a normal <span class="caps">API</span> request from a user viewing the FuelStream will <em>never</em> hit uncached content and be forced to wait.
Response times went from a dismal 10-20 seconds under load to 100ms or less with the cache&nbsp;enabled.</p>
